# Service Spot: Call Center Analysis

<h2>Power BI Project Overview</h2> 
<h5>Group: Alexandra CURRAN, Cl√©mence ROLDAN, Mathilde ROMAN</h5>

</br>
An IT company called Service Spot requested the creation of dashboards to gain insights on their call center data.</br></br>
We chose to split our findings into 3 dashboards:</br>
<strong>Overview:</strong>	A comprehensive snapshot of key performance metrics briefly for all call centers and overall.</br>
<strong>Employees:</strong>	A performance review of an employee for a given year.</br>
<strong>Call Centers:</strong>	A more tailored observation of key metrics for a call center for a given year.</br></br>

<strong>Here are our key findings:</strong>

<strong>Decrease in Call Volume / Regular Call Volume Spikes</strong></br>
The call volume has slightly decreased every year. However, we noticed that there seems to be a recurring spike in calls on March 1st, May 1st, July 1st, October 1st, and December 1st. We recommend that Service Spot have more employees on site to handle the call volume and increase efficiency.

<strong>Decrease in SLA-Compliant Calls</strong></br>
The percentage of SLA-compliant calls took a 10-point loss in 2021, going from 88% to 79%. This can be explained by the increase in call duration: the average duration of calls increased by 15 seconds between 2020 and 2021, while the average wait time increased by 10 seconds. Consequently, there was an increase in non-SLA compliant calls.
We also observed that the percentage of SLA-compliant calls suffered when the call volume increased dramatically.

<strong>Increase in Revenue / Revenue decline in February</strong></br>
The revenue has steadily grown over the years despite the small decrease in call volume. This is linked to the increase in price and average call duration that has increased each year.
We noticed a decrease in revenue each year in February, which can be explained by the low number of calls of types "Sales" that month, Sales being the most profitable call type.

<strong>Call Center Sites</strong></br>
Jacksonville has the highest revenue each year, which could potentially be explained by them having the highest number of employees and thus the ability to handle a larger call volume.</br></br>
<strong>Call Type</strong></br>
Tech support always had the most revenue throughout the year and the call centers. Even if the cost-per-minute is less than Sales or Billing, it has the greater quantity of calls.</br></br>
<strong>Employees</strong></br>
Employees from all sites have generally performed worst in 2021 compared to the other years. longer wait time, longer call duration and more calls abandoned.
